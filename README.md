# 📈 Time-Series Forecasting for Stock Prices  


📌 **Welcome to the Stock Price Prediction Project!**  
This project applies **Time-Series Forecasting** techniques to predict stock prices using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** and **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** models.  

## 🔍 Project Overview  
💰 **Goal:** Forecast stock prices based on historical data.  
📊 **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Statsmodels  
📂 **Dataset:** Stock market data (Open, Close, High, Low, Volume)  

## 🛠️ Features Implemented  
✅ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** (Handling missing values, feature scaling)  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** (Visualizing stock trends)  
✅ **Time-Series Modeling** (LSTM & ARIMA)  
✅ **Performance Evaluation** (MSE, RMSE, MAE)  

## 📈 Models Used  
- 🔹 **LSTM (Deep Learning-based Forecasting)**  
- 🔹 **ARIMA (Statistical Forecasting)**  

## 📂 Files in This Repository
